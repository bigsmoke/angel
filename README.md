# Angel

Angels don't exist. Therefore, every‘thing’ in a computer could be called an `angel`, because these ‘things’ are not really things; they're abstraction upon abstraction for what eventually boils down to processor instructions.

## BULL—BigSmoke's Unified Linking Language

If you say shit about non-existent entities, this shit is likely to be _bullshit_; hence the name for the language with which to query and describe angels: BULL.

BULL is a general-purpose computer language, and in order to serve is general purpose, it needs to be able to do only 2 things: (1) creating relationships between angels and (2) querying these relationships.

### Relating angels

Relate `angel 1` to `angel 2` through `relationship A` and `relationship B`, `angel 1` to `angel 3` through `relationship C`, and `angel 3` to `angel 4` through `relationship D`:

```
[ angel 1 \ relationship A > < relationship B / angel 2 ]
[ angel 1 \ < relationship C / angel 3 ]
[ angel 3 \ relationship D > / angel 4 ]
```

### Querying angels

Get to `angel 4`:

```
angel 1 \ < relationship C / ? \ relationship D > / ?
```

### Angels don't exist; thus, they can't be created

Angels aren't objects. They don't have a phsyical representation. They aren't objects. They're just an imaginary endpoints for relationships. To imagine a new angel into existence, the `+` placeholder is used:

```
angel 1 \ <relationship C / +
```

### Blocks

#### Heavy steps

```
[ angel 1 \ < relationship C / ? \ relationship D > // ? ]
```

### Querying relationships

*Not so sure about this part*

Are `angel 1` and `angel 2` related through `relationship A`?

```
angel 1 \ relationship A >? / angel 2
```

(How) are `angel 1` and `angel 2` related?

```
angel 1 \ ? > < ? / angel 2
```
