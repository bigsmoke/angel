# Angel

Angels don't exist. Therefore, every‘thing’ in a computer could be called an `angel`, because these ‘things’ are not really things; they're abstraction upon abstraction for what eventually boils down to processor instructions.

## BULL—BigSmoke's Unified Linking Language

If you say shit about non-existent entities, this shit is likely to be _bullshit_; hence the name for the language with which to query and describe `angel`s: BULL.

BULL is a general-purpose computer language, but in order to serve is general purpose, it needs to be able to do only 2 things: (1) creating relationships between angels and (2) querying these relationships.

```
angel 1 \ relationship A > < relationship B / angel 2
```
